## About
Final project for CPSC 408: Database Management
If you would like to re-create this project, you must install the following libraries and connect to a database with tables and entities which are laid out in SQL file included with this project.

If you decide to re-create our database, which will also make sure all data is up to data, file *createDatabase.py* can be used. Make sure to fill in your databases credentials within the file.

Else, here are the credentials to our pre-built database (STATIC DATABASE & NOT MAINTAINED):
  host = "34.132.124.28",
  user = "tyler",
  password = "rooter",
  database = 'finalproject'
